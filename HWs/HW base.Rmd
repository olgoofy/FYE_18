***General instructions for homeworks***: 

+  Make a new R Markdown file (.Rmd) referring to the assignment on the course Github page
+  Change the heading to include the homework number, your name, and the due date
+  Save the R Markdown file (named as:  [MikeID]-[hw01].Rmd -- e.g. "mlopez-hw01.Rmd") to somewhere where you'll be able to access it later (zip drive, My Documents, Dropbox, etc)
+  Your file should contain the code/commands to answer each question in its own code block, which will also produce plots that will be automatically embedded in the output file
+  **Each answer must be supported by written statements (unless otherwise specified) as well as any code used**: In other words, if the answer is `24`, you should write "The answer is 24" (as opposed to just showing the code and output).
+  Include the names of anyone you collaborated with at the top of the assignment
+  I recommend copying the raw .Rmd code from the Github page (link [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statsbylopez/FYE_18/master/HWs/HW%20base.Rmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statsbylopez/FYE_18/master/HWs/HW%20base.Rmd). 
+  Homeworks are due at the start of class -- please print the HTML and hand in. Be sure to staple your homework and ensure that it is in an easily readable format.
